# Breast-Cancer-Survival-Rate
In these notebooks, I used the available dataset on Kaggle to predict the survival rate of patients having breast cancer.

This is binary classification problem where class = 0 is for the patients who survive the disease and class = 1 is for patients who pass away from breats cancer.
There are three notebooks in this repository depending on the features used for training the models:
Model 1: I used only gene expression data and developed Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and shallow neural network for binary classification. 
Model 2: I used only general data such as "type of breast surgery", "chemotherapy", and etc., and developed Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and shallow neural network for binary classification. 
 Model 2: I used all gene expression and general data to develop Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and shallow neural network for binary classification.
